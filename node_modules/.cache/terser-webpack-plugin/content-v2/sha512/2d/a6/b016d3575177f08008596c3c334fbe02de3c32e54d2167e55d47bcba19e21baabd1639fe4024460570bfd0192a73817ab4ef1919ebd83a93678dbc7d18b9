In\\\\r\\\\ncurrently identified patients, there seems to be a spectrum of illness:\\\\r\\\\nA large number experience mild pneumonia-like symptoms, while others\\\\r\\\\nhave a much more severe response.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAccording to WHO COVID-19 affects different people in different ways.\\\\r\\\\nMost infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover\\\\r\\\\nwithout hospitalization.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMost common symptoms:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Fever, elevated body temperature\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Dry cough\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Fatigue or muscle pain\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Breathing difficulties\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLess common symptoms include these:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Coughing up mucus or blood\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Headaches\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Fatigue or muscle pain\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Diarrhoea\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Kidney failure\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Loss of taste or smell\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSerious symptoms:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Chest pain or pressure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Loss of speech or movement.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> As the disease progresses, patients also develop pneumonia, which\\\\r\\\\n> inflames the lungs and causes them to fill with fluid. This can be\\\\r\\\\n> detected by an X-ray. On average it takes 5--6 days from when someone\\\\r\\\\n> is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take\\\\r\\\\n> up to 14 days.\\xa0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**r nought value (R0 value), Pathogenesis,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\\\\\\"r nought\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (R0) value of the coronavirus is an indicator of how\\\\r\\\\nsuccessfully it spreads from person to person. This metric helps\\\\r\\\\ndetermine the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease. In the\\\\r\\\\nsimplest terms, the value relates to how many people can be infected by\\\\r\\\\none person carrying the disease. Experts use it to predict how far and\\\\r\\\\nhow fast a disease will spread, and the number can also inform policy\\\\r\\\\ndecisions about how to contain an outbreak.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInfectious diseases such as measles have an R0 of 12 to 18, which is\\\\r\\\\nremarkably high. The SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 had an R0 of around 3. A\\\\r\\\\nhandful of studies modelling the COVID-19 outbreak have given a similar\\\\r\\\\nvalue with a range between 1.4 and 3.8. However, there is plenty of\\\\r\\\\nvariation between studies and models attempting to predict the R0 of\\\\r\\\\nnovel coronavirus due to the constantly changing number of cases. It\\\\r\\\\nseems to have settled on a figure around 2.2, meaning every infected\\\\r\\\\nperson infects 2 others.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThree possibilities exist for the potential transmission or decline of a\\\\r\\\\ndisease, depending on its R~0~\\xa0value:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   If R~0~\\xa0is less than 1, each existing infection causes less than one\\\\r\\\\n    new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually\\\\r\\\\n    die out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   If R~0\\xa0~equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection.\\\\r\\\\n    The disease will stay alive and stable, but there won\\'t be an\\\\r\\\\n    outbreak or an epidemic.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   If R~0\\xa0~is more than 1, each existing infection causes more than one\\\\r\\\\n    new infection. The disease will be transmitted between people, and\\\\r\\\\n    there may be an outbreak or epidemic.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nImportantly, a disease\\'s R~0~\\xa0value only applies when everyone in a\\\\r\\\\npopulation is completely vulnerable to the disease. This means:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   no one has been vaccinated\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   no one has had the disease before\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   there\\'s no way to control the spread of the disease\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Diagnosis of the disease,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus (HCoV)\\\\r\\\\ninfections at the beginning of the twenty-first century have highlighted\\\\r\\\\nthe necessity for readily available, accurate and fast diagnostic\\\\r\\\\ntesting methods. The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus\\\\r\\\\ninfections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel\\\\r\\\\nassays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones.\\\\r\\\\nNewer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and\\\\r\\\\nare gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. \\xa0Viral\\\\r\\\\npneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum.\\\\r\\\\nThus, **a nasopharyngeal swab** is usually the collection method used to\\\\r\\\\nobtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some\\\\r\\\\ninfections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy.\\\\r\\\\nAlternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the\\\\r\\\\nlikelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases.\\\\r\\\\nSeveral integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are\\\\r\\\\ncurrently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of\\\\r\\\\nSARS-CoV-2 infections. These assays are simple, fast and safe and can be\\\\r\\\\nused in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of\\\\r\\\\nidentifying and treating patients.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Any recommended treatment of the disease, Ibuprofen use and\\\\r\\\\nwarnings,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCoronaviruses are hardy organisms. They\\\\\\\\\\'re effective at hiding from the\\\\r\\\\nhuman immune system, and we haven\\\\\\\\\\'t developed any reliable treatments\\\\r\\\\nor vaccines to eradicate them. In most cases, health officials attempt\\\\r\\\\nto deal with the symptoms. Notably, because they are viruses,\\\\r\\\\ncoronaviruses are not susceptible to antibiotics. Antibiotics are\\\\r\\\\nmedicines designed to fight bacteria and don\\\\\\\\\\'t do any damage to the\\\\r\\\\nSARS-CoV-2 virus. There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet,\\\\r\\\\nthough a number are in the works including experimental antivirals,\\\\r\\\\nwhich can attack the virus, and existing drugs targeted at other viruses\\\\r\\\\nlike HIV which have shown some promise.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIbuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug sold under various names such as\\\\r\\\\nBrufen, Nurofen and Advil, has been linked with adverse outcomes for\\\\r\\\\npatients with COVID-19. There\\'s been some\\xa0confusion on whether we should\\\\r\\\\nor shouldn\\'t take ibuprofen to treat symptoms of COVID-19 -- especially\\\\r\\\\nafter the World Health Organization (WHO) changed its stance. After\\\\r\\\\ninitially recommending people avoid taking ibuprofen to treat symptoms\\\\r\\\\nof the new coronavirus disease,\\xa0as of March 19\\xa0the WHO now does not\\\\r\\\\nrecommend avoiding ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe confusion began after France\\'s Minister of Solidarity and\\\\r\\\\nHealth\\xa0[Oliver V\\xe9ran](https://twitter.com/olivierveran)\\xa0announced that\\\\r\\\\ntaking anti-inflammatory drugs (such as\\xa0ibuprofen or\\xa0cortisone) could be\\\\r\\\\na factor in worsening a COVID-19 infection.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**, Vaccine research,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCurrently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with\\\\r\\\\nSARS-CoV-2. Developing new vaccines takes time and they must be\\\\r\\\\nrigorously tested and confirmed safe via clinical trials before they can\\\\r\\\\nbe routinely used in humans. Anthony Fauci, director of the National\\\\r\\\\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US, has frequently\\\\r\\\\nstated that a vaccine is at least a year to 18 months away. Experts\\\\r\\\\nagree there\\\\\\\\\\'s a ways to go yet. However, there is great progress being\\\\r\\\\nmade, and a number of vaccine candidates have appeared in the time since\\\\r\\\\nCOVID-19 was discovered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn developing a vaccine that targets SARS-CoV-2, scientists are looking\\\\r\\\\nintensely at the spike proteins. These proteins, which are present on\\\\r\\\\nthe surface of the virus, enable it to enter human cells where it can\\\\r\\\\nreplicate and make copies of itself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine designed\\\\r\\\\nto protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at\\\\r\\\\nKaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in\\\\r\\\\nSeattle. The\\xa0National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\\\\r\\\\n(NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is funding the\\\\r\\\\ntrial. KPWHRI is part of NIAID\\'s\\xa0Infectious Diseases Clinical Research\\\\r\\\\nConsortium. The open-label trial has enrolled 45 healthy adult\\\\r\\\\nvolunteers\\' ages 18 to 55 years over approximately 6 weeks. The vaccine\\\\r\\\\nis called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID scientists and their\\\\r\\\\ncollaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in\\\\r\\\\nCambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness\\\\r\\\\nInnovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate\\\\r\\\\nfor the Phase 1 clinical trial.\\\\r\\\\n\"},{\"title\":\"Origin\",\"slug\":\"Origin\",\"content\":\"**Module 1 Subtopic 1**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Origin and hard facts :**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Coronavirus in severe acute respiratory syndrome**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn November 2002, a flare-up of a perilous \\\\\\\\\\'atypical pneumonia\\\\\\\\\\' for\\\\r\\\\nwhich no pathogen could be recognized happened in Guangdong Province,\\\\r\\\\nChina.

As\\\\r\\\\nsoon as the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in late December 2019,\\\\r\\\\ninvestigations were conducted to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19\\\\r\\\\nand the original source of the outbreak. A large proportion of the\\\\r\\\\ninitial cases in late December 2019 and early January 2020 had a direct\\\\r\\\\nlink to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan City, where\\\\r\\\\nseafood, wild, and farmed animal species were sold. Many of the initial\\\\r\\\\npatients were shopkeepers, market employees, vendors or regular visitors\\\\r\\\\nto this market. Environmental samples taken from this market in December\\\\r\\\\n2019 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, further suggesting that the market\\\\r\\\\nin Wuhan City was the source of this outbreak or played a role in the\\\\r\\\\ninitial amplification of the outbreak. The market was closed on 1\\\\r\\\\nJanuary 2020 and was cleaned and disinfected. The virus could have been\\\\r\\\\nintroduced into the human population from an animal source in the market\\\\r\\\\nor an infected human could have introduced the virus to the market and\\\\r\\\\nthe virus may have then been amplified in the market environment.\\\\r\\\\nSubsequent investigations into the first human cases have determined\\\\r\\\\nthat they had onset of symptoms around 1 December 2019. However, these\\\\r\\\\ncases had no direct link to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market and they\\\\r\\\\nmay therefore have been infected in November through contact with\\\\r\\\\nearlier undetected cases (incubation time between date of exposure and\\\\r\\\\ndate of symptom onset can be up to 14 days).

A full lockdown will mean you must stay where you\\\\r\\\\nare and not exit or enter a building or the given area.\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\nThis scenario usually allows for essential supplies, grocery stores,\\\\r\\\\npharmacies and banks to continue to serve the people. All non-essential\\\\r\\\\nactivities remain shut for the entire period. Essential activities\\\\r\\\\ninclude picking up groceries and medical supplies, going to doctor and\\\\r\\\\ngoing on a walk provided you are following social distancing. If you\\\\r\\\\nwork for an essential service, you will not need to adhere to these\\\\r\\\\nrestrictions.\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\nThe quarantine of persons is the restriction of activities of or the\\\\r\\\\nseparation of persons who are not ill but who may been exposed to an\\\\r\\\\ninfectious agent or disease, with the objective of monitoring their\\\\r\\\\nsymptoms and ensuring the early detection of cases. Quarantine is\\\\r\\\\ndifferent from isolation, which is the separation of ill or infected\\\\r\\\\npersons from others\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nto prevent the spread of infection or contamination. Introducing\\\\r\\\\nquarantine measures early in an outbreak may delay the introduction of\\\\r\\\\nthe disease to a country or area or may delay the peak of an epidemic in\\\\r\\\\nan area where local transmission is ongoing, or both. However, if not\\\\r\\\\nimplemented properly, quarantine may also create additional sources of\\\\r\\\\ncontamination and dissemination of the disease.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Home care of patients with mild symptoms and management of their\\\\r\\\\ncontacts,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWHO recommends that all laboratory confirmed cases be isolated and cared\\\\r\\\\nfor in a health care facility. WHO recommends that all persons with\\\\r\\\\nsuspected COVID-19 who have severe acute respiratory infection be\\\\r\\\\ntriaged at the first point of contact with the health care system and\\\\r\\\\nthat emergency treatment should be started based on disease severity.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor those having a mild illness, hospitalization may not be conceivable\\\\r\\\\nas a result of the weight on the healthcare framework. If there are\\\\r\\\\npatients with mild illness, giving consideration at home might be\\\\r\\\\nthought of, as long as they can be followed up and cared for by family\\\\r\\\\nmembers. Home consideration may likewise be viewed as when inpatient\\\\r\\\\ncare is inaccessible or unsafe (e.g. capacity is limited, and resources\\\\r\\\\nare unable to meet the demand for health care services).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn any of these situations, patients with mild symptoms and without\\\\r\\\\nunderlying chronic conditions \\u2212 such as lung or heart disease, renal\\\\r\\\\nfailure, or immunocompromising conditions that place the patient at\\\\r\\\\nincreased risk of developing complications \\u2212 may be cared for at home.\\\\r\\\\nThis decision requires careful clinical judgment and should be informed\\\\r\\\\nby an assessment of the safety of the patient\\'s home environment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPatients and household members should be educated about personal\\\\r\\\\nhygiene, basic IPC measures, and how to care as safely as possible for\\\\r\\\\nthe person suspected of having COVID- 19 to prevent the infection from\\\\r\\\\nspreading to household contacts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Safe management of dead body in the context of covid 19,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCOVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 virus that\\\\r\\\\npredominantly affects the lungs.

Give the family clear instructions not to touch or kiss the\\\\r\\\\n    body;\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Embalming is not recommended to avoid excessive manipulation of the\\\\r\\\\n    body;\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Adults \\\\\\\\>60 years and immunosuppressed persons should not directly\\\\r\\\\n    interact with the body.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n#### **At Crematorium or Burial Ground**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   The Crematorium or Burial Ground staff should be sensitised that\\\\r\\\\n    Covid-19 does not pose additional risk.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   The staff will practice standard precautions of hand hygiene, use of\\\\r\\\\n    masks and gloves.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Viewing of the dead body by unzipping the face end of the body bag\\\\r\\\\n    (by the staff using standard precautions) may be allowed, for the\\\\r\\\\n    relatives to see the body for one last time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Religious rituals such as reading from religious scripts, sprinkling\\\\r\\\\n    holy water and any other last rites that do not require touching of\\\\r\\\\n    the body can be allowed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Bathing, kissing, hugging, etc. of the dead body should not be\\\\r\\\\n    allowed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   The funeral or burial staff and family members should perform hand\\\\r\\\\n    hygiene after cremation or burial.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   The ash does not pose any risk and can be collected to perform the\\\\r\\\\n    last rites.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   The large gathering at the crematorium or burial ground should be\\\\r\\\\n    avoided as a social distancing measure as it is possible that close\\\\r\\\\n    family contacts may be symptomatic and/or shedding the virus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Interim guidelines (before and after outbreak)**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Before the outbreak**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA COVID-19 outbreak could last for a long time in a community. Depending\\\\r\\\\non the severity of the outbreak, public health officials may recommend\\\\r\\\\ncommunity actions designed to help keep people healthy, reduce exposures\\\\r\\\\nto COVID-19, and slow the spread of the disease. Local public health\\\\r\\\\nofficials may make recommendations appropriate to your local situation.\\\\r\\\\nCreating a household plan can help protect your health and the health of\\\\r\\\\nthose you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your\\\\r\\\\ncommunity. You should base the details of your household plan on the\\\\r\\\\nneeds and daily routine of your household members.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan -** Meet\\\\r\\\\n    with household members, other relatives, and friends to discuss what\\\\r\\\\n    to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community and what the\\\\r\\\\n    needs of each person will be.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for\\\\r\\\\n    serious complications -**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> There is limited information about who may be at risk for severe\\\\r\\\\n> complications from COVID-19 illness. From the data that are available\\\\r\\\\n> for COVID-19 patients, it is possible that older adults and persons\\\\r\\\\n> who have underlying chronic medical conditions may be at risk for more\\\\r\\\\n> serious complications.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Identify aid organizations in your community-** Create a list of\\\\r\\\\n    local organizations that you and your household can contact in the\\\\r\\\\n    event you need access to information, health care services, support,\\\\r\\\\n    and resources.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Create an emergency contact list -** Ensure your household has a\\\\r\\\\n    current list of emergency contacts for family, friends, neighbors,\\\\r\\\\n    carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the\\\\r\\\\n    local public health department, and other community resources.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Practice everyday preventive actions now.** Remind everyone in\\\\r\\\\n    your household of the importance of practicing everyday preventive\\\\r\\\\n    actions that can help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n2.  Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n3.  Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n4.  Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily (e.g., tables,\\\\r\\\\n    countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles) using a\\\\r\\\\n    regular household detergent and water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> **After the outbreak**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA COVID-19 outbreak could last a long time. The impact on individuals,\\\\r\\\\nhouseholds, and communities might be great. When public health officials\\\\r\\\\ndetermine the outbreak has ended in your community, take time to improve\\\\r\\\\nyour household\\'s plan. As public health officials continue to plan for\\\\r\\\\nCOVID-19 and other disease outbreaks, you and your household also have\\\\r\\\\nan important role to play in ongoing planning efforts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Discuss and note lessons learned.** Were your COVID-19\\\\r\\\\n    preparedness actions effective at home, school, and work? Talk about\\\\r\\\\n    problems found in your plan and effective solutions. Identify\\\\r\\\\n    additional resources needed for you and your household.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Participate in community discussions about emergency planning.**\\\\r\\\\n    Let others know about what readiness actions worked for you and your\\\\r\\\\n    household. Maintain communication lines with your community (e.g.,\\\\r\\\\n    social media and email lists).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Continue to practice everyday preventive actions.** Stay home when\\\\r\\\\n    you are sick; cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue; wash your\\\\r\\\\n    hands often with soap and water; and clean frequently touched\\\\r\\\\n    surfaces and objects daily.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Take care of the emotional health of your household members.**\\\\r\\\\n    Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will\\\\r\\\\n    fade. Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news\\\\r\\\\n    stories about COVID-19. Connect with family and friends. Share your\\\\r\\\\n    concerns and how you are feeling with others.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Help your child/children cope after the outbreak.** Provide\\\\r\\\\n    children with opportunities to talk about what they went through or\\\\r\\\\n    what they think about it. Encourage them to share concerns and ask\\\\r\\\\n    questions. Because parents, teachers, and other adults see children\\\\r\\\\n    in different situations, it is important for them to work together\\\\r\\\\n    to share information about how each child is coping after the\\\\r\\\\n    outbreak.\\\\r\\\\n\"},{\"title\":\"Myths and Misconceptions\",\"slug\":\"myths-and-misconceptions\",\"content\":\"**Myths and misconceptions**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic has become one of the gravest health\\\\r\\\\ncrises faced by humanity in recent times.. And so, along with the\\\\r\\\\nvirus\\\\\\\\\\'s spread across the growth, myths about the contagion, treatments\\\\r\\\\nfor the Covid-19 disease and preventive steps to keep yourself safe from\\\\r\\\\nthe novel coronavirus have proliferated. It is very important to refrain\\\\r\\\\nfrom placing your belief in any miraculous cures or conspiracy theories\\\\r\\\\nabout Covid-19. And so, let\\'s take a look at some widely shared myths\\\\r\\\\nabout the novel coronavirus and weight their standing on the scale of\\\\r\\\\nscientific relevance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**People of all ages are at risk,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**False.** People of ALL AGES can be infected by the new coronavirus.\\\\r\\\\nOlder people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as\\\\r\\\\nasthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to\\\\r\\\\nbecoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to\\\\r\\\\ntake steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by\\\\r\\\\nfollowing good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Antibiotics do not work against coronavirus, No specific medicine till\\\\r\\\\ndate,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**False.** No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine\\\\r\\\\nand Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide\\\\r\\\\nprotection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and\\\\r\\\\ndifferent that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to\\\\r\\\\ndevelop a vaccine against COVID-19, and WHO is supporting their efforts.\\\\r\\\\nAlthough these vaccines are not effective against COVID-19, vaccination\\\\r\\\\nagainst respiratory illnesses such as flu is highly recommended to\\\\r\\\\nprotect your health.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**, You can recover from Covid-19 infection**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**TRUE** Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate\\\\r\\\\nthe virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you\\\\r\\\\ntreat your symptoms. If you have cough, fever, and difficulty breathing,\\\\r\\\\nseek medical care early.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Exposing yourself to temperatures higher than 25^o^C degrees DOES NOT\\\\r\\\\nprevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19); Covid-19 can be transmitted\\\\r\\\\nin high temp and humid conditions, Cold temp and snow cannot kill\\\\r\\\\nvirus,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**False.** The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including\\\\r\\\\nareas with hot and humid weather. Taking a hot bath will not prevent you\\\\r\\\\nfrom catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around\\\\r\\\\n36.5\\xb0C to 37\\xb0C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower.\\\\r\\\\nActually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as\\\\r\\\\nit can burn you. There is no reason to believe that cold weather can\\\\r\\\\nkill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The best way to protect\\\\r\\\\nyourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing\\\\r\\\\nthis you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection\\\\r\\\\nthat could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Breath holding for 10 seconds is an indication that you are free of\\\\r\\\\nthe disease**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**False**\\xa0Dr Faheem Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at the\\\\r\\\\nUniversity of Maryland says that a person infected with the novel\\\\r\\\\ncoronavirus can also hold his/her breath for longer than 10 seconds. On\\\\r\\\\nthe other hand, the elderly will not be able to accomplish this task but\\\\r\\\\nit does not in any way mean that they are infected.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**, Drinking alcohol does not protect and can be harmful,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**TRUE.** These products are highly toxic and should\\xa0***never\\xa0***be\\\\r\\\\nswallowed or injected into the body. Drinking them can lead to\\\\r\\\\ndisability and death.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDisinfectants, bleach and soap and water may be used to clean surfaces,\\\\r\\\\nan important prevention step in stopping the spread of coronavirus and\\\\r\\\\nCOVID-19 --- the disease caused by the coronavirus that\\'s led to the\\\\r\\\\nglobal pandemic.**\\xa0Never**\\xa0attempt to self-treat or prevent COVID-19 by\\\\r\\\\nrubbing or bathing with bleach, disinfectants or rubbing alcohol\\\\r\\\\nanywhere on your body. Effective hand sanitizers do have alcohol, but\\\\r\\\\nthey are formulated to be safe for use on hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**new Covid-19/coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquitos,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**TRUE** To date there has been no evidence to suggest that the new\\\\r\\\\ncoronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a\\\\r\\\\nrespiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated\\\\r\\\\nwhen an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva\\\\r\\\\nor discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands\\\\r\\\\nfrequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and\\\\r\\\\nwater. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and\\\\r\\\\nsneezing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**UV disinfection,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**FALSE.** UV radiation can cause skin irritation and damage your eyes.\\\\r\\\\nCleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing your hands\\\\r\\\\nwith soap and water are the most effective ways to remove the virus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Garlic has shown antibiotic activity and may not kill virus,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**TRUE.** There is no evidence that consumption of garlic has protected\\\\r\\\\npeople from\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\ninfection with the new coronavirus.Garlic is a healthy food that may\\\\r\\\\nhave some antimicrobial properties.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**5G mobile networks cannot spread Covid-19,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**TRUE.

At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant\\\\r\\\\nrole in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. There is a small\\\\r\\\\nnumber of animals around the world reported to be infected with the\\\\r\\\\nvirus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having close contact with a\\\\r\\\\nperson with COVID-19.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Vitamin-C may prevent,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**FALSE** Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that can support immune\\\\r\\\\nfunction.

In an outbreak, this may mean people are\\\\r\\\\nlabelled, stereotyped, discriminated against, treated separately, and/or\\\\r\\\\nexperience loss of status because of a perceived link with a disease.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSuch treatment can negatively affect those with the disease, as well as\\\\r\\\\ntheir caregivers, family, friends and communities. People who don\\'t have\\\\r\\\\nthe disease but share other characteristics with this group may also\\\\r\\\\nsuffer from stigma.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe current COVID-19 outbreak has provoked social stigma and\\\\r\\\\ndiscriminatory behaviors against people of certain ethnic backgrounds as\\\\r\\\\nwell as anyone perceived to have been in contact with the virus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Reasons and impact of social stigma,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe level of stigma associated with COVID-19 is based on three main\\\\r\\\\nfactors: 1) it is a disease that\\'s new and for which there are still\\\\r\\\\nmany unknowns; 2) we are often afraid of the unknown; and 3) it is easy\\\\r\\\\nto associate that fear with \\'others\\'.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is understandable that there is confusion, anxiety, and fear among\\\\r\\\\nthe public. Unfortunately, these factors are also fueling harmful\\\\r\\\\nstereotypes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStigma can undermine social cohesion and prompt possible social\\\\r\\\\nisolation of groups, which might contribute to a situation where the\\\\r\\\\nvirus is more, not less, likely to spread. This can result in more\\\\r\\\\nsevere health problems and difficulties controlling a disease outbreak.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStigma can:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Drive people to hide the illness to avoid discrimination\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Prevent people from seeking health care immediately\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Addressing social stigma,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEvidence clearly shows that stigma and fear around communicable diseases\\\\r\\\\nhamper the response.

An environment needs to be created in which the disease\\\\r\\\\nand its impact can be discussed and addressed openly, honestly and\\\\r\\\\neffectively.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHere are some tips on how to address and avoid compounding, social\\\\r\\\\nstigma:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1\\\\\\\\. Words matter: dos and don\\'ts when talking about the new coronavirus\\\\r\\\\n(COVID-19)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen talking about coronavirus disease, certain words (i.e suspect case,\\\\r\\\\nisolation...) and language may have a negative meaning for people and\\\\r\\\\nfuel stigmatizing attitudes. They can perpetuate existing negative\\\\r\\\\nstereotypes or assumptions, strengthen false associations between the\\\\r\\\\ndisease and other factors, create widespread fear, or dehumanise those\\\\r\\\\nwho have the disease. This can drive people away from getting screened,\\\\r\\\\ntested and quarantined.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n2\\\\\\\\. Do your part: simple ideas to drive stigma away\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGovernments, citizens, media, key influencers and communities have an\\\\r\\\\nimportant role to play in preventing and stopping stigma surrounding\\\\r\\\\npeople from China and Asia in general. We all need to be intentional and\\\\r\\\\nthoughtful when communicating on social media and other communication\\\\r\\\\nplatforms, showing supportive behaviors around the new coronavirus\\\\r\\\\ndisease (COVID-19).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHere are some examples and tips on possible actions to counter\\\\r\\\\nstigmatizing attitudes:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Spreading the facts : Stigma can be heightened by insufficient\\\\r\\\\n    knowledge about how the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is\\\\r\\\\n    transmitted and treated, and how to prevent infection. In response,\\\\r\\\\n    prioritise the collection, consolidation and dissemination of\\\\r\\\\n    accurate country- and community-specific information about affected\\\\r\\\\n    areas, individual and group vulnerability to COVID-19, treatment\\\\r\\\\n    options and where to access health care and information.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Engaging social influencers : such as religious leaders on prompting\\\\r\\\\n    reflection about people who are stigmatized and how to support them,\\\\r\\\\n    or respected celebrities to amplify messages that reduce stigma. The\\\\r\\\\n    information should be well targeted and the celebrities who are\\\\r\\\\n    asked to communicate this information must be personally engaged,\\\\r\\\\n    and geographically and culturally appropriate to the audiences they\\\\r\\\\n    seek to influence.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Ethical journalism : Journalistic reporting which overly focuses on\\\\r\\\\n    individual behaviour and patients\\' responsibility for having and\\\\r\\\\n    \\\\\"spreading COVID-19\\\\\" can increase stigma of people who may have the\\\\r\\\\n    disease. Some media outlets have, for example, focused on\\\\r\\\\n    speculating on the source of COVID-19, trying to identify \\\\\"patient\\\\r\\\\n    zero\\\\\" in each country. Emphasizing efforts to find a vaccine and\\\\r\\\\n    treatment can increase fear and give the impression that we are\\\\r\\\\n    powerless to halt infections now. Instead, promote content around\\\\r\\\\n    basic infection prevention practices, symptoms of COVID-19 and when\\\\r\\\\n    to seek health care.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n3\\\\\\\\. Communication tips and messages.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn \\\\\"infodemic\\\\\" of misinformation and rumours is spreading more quickly\\\\r\\\\nthan the current outbreak of the new coronavirus (COVID-19). This\\\\r\\\\ncontributes to negative effects including stigmatization and\\\\r\\\\ndiscrimination of people from areas affected by the outbreak. We need\\\\r\\\\ncollective solidarity and clear, actionable information to support\\\\r\\\\ncommunities and people affected by this new outbreak. Misconceptions,\\\\r\\\\nrumours and misinformation are contributing to stigma and discrimination\\\\r\\\\nwhich hamper response efforts. Collective solidarity and global\\\\r\\\\ncooperation are needed to prevent further transmission and alleviate the\\\\r\\\\nconcerns of communities. Facts, not fear will stop the spread of novel\\\\r\\\\ncoronavirus (COVID-19)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Role of Communicators and public health officials in reducing\\\\r\\\\nstigma,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Maintain privacy and confidentiality of those seeking healthcare and\\\\r\\\\n    those who may be part of any contact investigation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Quickly communicate the risk or lack of risk from associations with\\\\r\\\\n    products, people, and places.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Raise awareness about COVID-19 without increasing fear.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Share accurate information about how the virus spreads.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Speak out against negative behaviors, including negative statements\\\\r\\\\n    on social media about groups of people, or exclusion of people who\\\\r\\\\n    pose no risk from regular activities.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Be cautious about the images that are shared. Make sure they do not\\\\r\\\\n    reinforce stereotypes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Engage with stigmatized groups in person and through media channels\\\\r\\\\n    including news media and social media.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Withstand and recover from stress**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be stressful for\\\\r\\\\npeople. Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause\\\\r\\\\nstrong emotions in adults and children.\\xa0**Coping with stress will make\\\\r\\\\nyou, the people you care about, and your community stronger.**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStress during an infectious disease outbreak can include\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Fear and worry about your own health and the health of your loved\\\\r\\\\n    ones\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Changes in sleep or eating patterns\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Difficulty sleeping or concentrating\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Worsening of chronic health problems\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Worsening of mental health conditions\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Increased use of\\xa0alcohol,\\xa0tobacco, or\\xa0other drugs\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTaking care of yourself, your friends, and your family can help you cope\\\\r\\\\nwith stress.

Ensuring good and\\\\r\\\\nconsistently applied WASH and waste management practices in communities,\\\\r\\\\nhomes, schools, marketplaces, and health care facilities will help\\\\r\\\\nprevent human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe COVID-19 virus is an enveloped virus, with a fragile outer membrane.\\\\r\\\\nGenerally, enveloped viruses are less stable in the environment and are\\\\r\\\\nmore susceptible to oxidants, such as chlorine. While there is no\\\\r\\\\nevidence to date about survival of the COVID-19 virus in water or\\\\r\\\\nsewage, the virus is likely to become inactivated significantly faster\\\\r\\\\nthan non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne\\\\r\\\\ntransmission.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Water hygiene**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking-water supplies, and\\\\r\\\\nbased on current evidence; the risk to water supplies is low. Laboratory\\\\r\\\\nstudies of surrogate coronaviruses that took place in well-controlled\\\\r\\\\nenvironments indicated that the virus could remain infectious in water\\\\r\\\\ncontaminated with faeces for days to weeks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA number of measures can be taken to improve water safety, starting with\\\\r\\\\nprotecting the source water; treating water at the point of\\\\r\\\\ndistribution, collection, or consumption; and ensuring that treated\\\\r\\\\nwater is safely stored at home in regularly cleaned and covered\\\\r\\\\ncontainers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConventional, centralized water treatment methods that use filtration\\\\r\\\\nand disinfection should inactivate the COVID-19 virus. Other human\\\\r\\\\ncoronaviruses have been shown to be sensitive to chlorination and\\\\r\\\\ndisinfection with ultraviolet (UV) light. As enveloped viruses are\\\\r\\\\nsurrounded by a lipid host cell membrane, which is not robust, the\\\\r\\\\nCOVID-19 virus\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nis likely to be more sensitive to chlorine and other oxidant\\\\r\\\\ndisinfection processes than many other viruses, such as\\\\r\\\\ncoxsackieviruses, which have a protein coat. For effective centralized\\\\r\\\\ndisinfection, there should be a residual concentration of free chlorine\\\\r\\\\nof \\u22650.5 mg/L after at least 30 minutes of contact time at pH \\\\\\\\<8.0.\\\\r\\\\nChlorine residual should be maintained throughout the distribution\\\\r\\\\nsystem.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**hygiene and waste management**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere is no evidence that the COVID-19 virus has been transmitted via\\\\r\\\\nsewerage systems with or without wastewater treatment. Further, there is\\\\r\\\\nno evidence that sewage or wastewater treatment workers contracted the\\\\r\\\\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by another\\\\r\\\\ntype of coronavirus that caused a large outbreak of acute respiratory\\\\r\\\\nillness in 2003. As part of an integrated public health policy,\\\\r\\\\nwastewater carried in sewerage systems should be treated in\\\\r\\\\nwell-designed and well-managed centralized wastewater treatment works.\\\\r\\\\nEach stage of treatment (as well as retention time and dilution) results\\\\r\\\\nin a further reduction of the potential risk. A waste stabilization pond\\\\r\\\\n(an oxidation pond or lagoon) is generally considered a practical and\\\\r\\\\nsimple wastewater treatment technology particularly well suited to\\\\r\\\\ndestroying pathogens, as relatively long retention times (20 days or\\\\r\\\\nlonger) combined with sunlight, elevated pH levels, biological activity,\\\\r\\\\nand other factors serve to accelerate pathogen destruction. A final\\\\r\\\\ndisinfection step may be considered if existing wastewater treatment\\\\r\\\\nplants are not optimized to remove viruses. Best practices for\\\\r\\\\nprotecting the health of workers at sanitation treatment facilities\\\\r\\\\nshould be followed. Workers should wear appropriate personal protective\\\\r\\\\nequipment (PPE), which includes protective outerwear, gloves, boots,\\\\r\\\\ngoggles or a face shield, and a mask; they should perform hand hygiene\\\\r\\\\nfrequently; and they should avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with\\\\r\\\\nunwashed hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Personal Hygiene**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEveryone must practise good hygiene to protect against infection and\\\\r\\\\nprevent the virus spreading. When you practise good hygiene you:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   put used tissues straight into the bin\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   wash your hands often with soap and water, including before and\\\\r\\\\n    after eating and after going to the toilet\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   use alcohol-based hand sanitisers\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces such as benchtops,\\\\r\\\\n    desks and doorknobs\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   clean and disinfect frequently used objects such as mobile phones,\\\\r\\\\n    keys, wallets and work passes\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   increase the amount of fresh air available by opening windows or\\\\r\\\\n    adjusting air conditioning\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Proper cleaning of hands, When to wash your hands, Science behind hand\\\\r\\\\nwashing,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWashing your hands correctly (or using an alcohol-based hand rub) is the\\\\r\\\\nmost effective\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nthing you can do to protect yourself against a number of infectious\\\\r\\\\ndiseases, such as\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\ninfluenza (the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"flu\\\\\\\\\\\\\") and the common cold. Not only will it help keep\\\\r\\\\nyou healthy, it\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nwill help prevent the spread of infectious diseases to others.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the context of COVID-19 prevention, you should make sure to wash your\\\\r\\\\nhands at the following times:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After visiting a public space, including public transportation,\\\\r\\\\n    markets and places of worship\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After touching surfaces outside of the home, including money\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Before, during and after caring for a sick person\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Before and after eating\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn general, you should always wash your hands at the following times:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After using the toilet\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Before and after eating\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After handling garbage\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After touching animals and pets\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After changing babies\\' diapers or helping children use the toilet\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   When your hands are visibly dirty\\xa0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn a purely physical level,\\xa0**hand washing**\\xa0works by actually removing\\\\r\\\\nthe microbes from your\\xa0**hand**\\xa0thanks to some basic chemistry. Soap is\\\\r\\\\nwhat\\\\\\\\\\'s known as a surfactant, which means it breaks down the oils and\\\\r\\\\ndirt on your skin; water rinses the broken-down oils and dirt away,\\\\r\\\\ncarrying microbes along for the ride.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Hand washing: Kitchen and family activity,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHandwashing is one of the most important things you can do to prevent\\\\r\\\\nfood poisoning when you are preparing food for yourself or loved ones.\\\\r\\\\nWashing your hands frequently with soap and water is an easy way to\\\\r\\\\nprevent germs from spreading around your kitchen and to other foods.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Wash your hands often when you cook to prevent the spread of\\\\r\\\\ngerms.**\\xa0Your hands can spread germs in the kitchen, so wash your hands\\\\r\\\\noften to prevent cross-contamination. Handwashing is especially\\\\r\\\\nimportant during\\xa0key times\\xa0when germs can spread. Here are some key\\\\r\\\\ntimes to wash in the kitchen:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Before, during, and after preparing any food.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Before eating.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After touching garbage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After wiping counters or cleaning other surfaces with chemicals.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After touching pets, pet food, or pet treats.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   After coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> **Role of hand sanitizers,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCleaning hands at key times with soap and water or hand sanitizer that\\\\r\\\\ncontains at least 60% alcohol is one of the most important steps you can\\\\r\\\\ntake to avoid getting sick and spreading germs to those around you.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere are important differences between washing hands with soap and\\\\r\\\\nwater and using hand sanitizer. Soap and water work to remove all types\\\\r\\\\nof germs from hands, while sanitizer acts by killing certain germs on\\\\r\\\\nthe skin. Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the\\\\r\\\\nnumber of germs in many situations, they should be used in the right\\\\r\\\\nsituations. Soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizers at\\\\r\\\\nremoving certain kinds of germs like\\xa0norovirus,\\xa0*Cryptosporidium*,\\\\r\\\\nand\\xa0*Clostridioides difficile*, as well as chemicals.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Avoid close contact with others, cover your mouth and nose, cover\\\\r\\\\ncough and sneez , clean and disinfect,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this\\\\r\\\\nvirus.The virus is thought to\\xa0spread mainly from person-to-person\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Between people who are in close contact with one another (within\\\\r\\\\n    about 6 feet).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person\\\\r\\\\n    coughs, sneezes or talks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are\\\\r\\\\n    nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCovering coughs and sneezes and keeping hands clean can help prevent the\\\\r\\\\nspread of serious respiratory illnesses like influenza, respiratory\\\\r\\\\nsyncytial virus (RSV), whooping cough, and COVID-19. Germs can be easily\\\\r\\\\nspread by:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**To help stop the spread of germs**:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Throw used tissues in the trash\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   If you don\\'t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not\\\\r\\\\n    your hands\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRemember to immediately\\xa0wash your hands\\xa0after blowing your nose,\\\\r\\\\ncoughing or sneezing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Cleaning around the home,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces in your home regularly is\\\\r\\\\nan important precaution to lower the risk of infection.\\xa0Follow cleaning\\\\r\\\\nproduct instructions for safe and effective use, including precautions\\\\r\\\\nyou should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and\\\\r\\\\nmaking sure you have good ventilation. Each house is extraordinary, yet\\\\r\\\\nbasic high-contact surfaces include: Door handles, tables, seats,\\\\r\\\\nhandrails, kitchen and restroom surfaces, taps, toilets, light switches,\\\\r\\\\ncell phones, PCs, tablets, consoles, remote controls, game controllers\\\\r\\\\nand most loved toys. If a surface is dirty, first clean it with soap or\\\\r\\\\ndetergent\\xa0and water. Then use a disinfectant product containing alcohol\\\\r\\\\n(of around 70 per cent) or bleach. Vinegar and other natural products\\\\r\\\\nare not recommended.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn many places it can be difficult to find disinfectant sprays and\\\\r\\\\nwipes. In such cases, continue to clean with soap and water. Diluted\\\\r\\\\nhousehold bleach solutions may also be used on some surfaces.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt\\'s important not to wipe cleaning solutions off as soon as you\\'ve\\\\r\\\\napplied it to a surface. Many disinfectant products, such as wipes and\\\\r\\\\nsprays, need to stay wet on a surface for several minutes in order to be\\\\r\\\\neffective. Always read the directions to make sure you\\'re using the\\\\r\\\\nproducts as recommended and to avoid damaging sensitive items such as\\\\r\\\\nmobile phones and other electronic devices.

While a lot is still\\\\r\\\\nunknown about the virus that causes COVID-19, we do know that it is\\\\r\\\\ntransmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an\\\\r\\\\ninfected person (generated through coughing and sneezing) Individuals\\\\r\\\\ncan also be infected from touching surfaces contaminated with the virus\\\\r\\\\nand touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). While COVID-19\\\\r\\\\ncontinues to spread it is important that communities take action to\\\\r\\\\nprevent further transmission, reduce the impacts of the outbreak and\\\\r\\\\nsupport control measures.\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\nToday, children and young people are global citizens, powerful agents of\\\\r\\\\nchange and the next generation of caregivers, scientists, and doctors.\\\\r\\\\nAny crisis presents the opportunity to help them learn, cultivate\\\\r\\\\ncompassion and increase resilience while building a safer and more\\\\r\\\\ncaring community. Having information and facts about COVID-19 will help\\\\r\\\\ndiminish students\\' fears and anxieties around the disease and support\\\\r\\\\ntheir ability to cope with any secondary impacts in their lives.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Medical Students\\' Participation in Direct Patient Contact,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRisk is inherent in medicine --- for patients and for health care\\\\r\\\\nworkers. Usually risks to clinicians are small, manageable, and accepted\\\\r\\\\nby these workers as part of their responsibility to act in a patient\\'s\\\\r\\\\nbest interest. But providing care to patients with communicable diseases\\\\r\\\\ncan be frightening. Over the past four weeks, substantial progress has\\\\r\\\\nbeen made in (a) efforts to \\\\\"flatten the curve\\\\\" through adherence to\\\\r\\\\npublic health guidelines, (b) availability of PPE, and (c) COVID-19\\\\r\\\\ntesting availability. Globally, knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, the virus\\\\r\\\\nthat causes COVID-19, advances daily. Steady progress continues in the\\\\r\\\\ndevelopment of therapeutic approaches to and testing for COVID-19. The\\\\r\\\\nresponse of medical students to this unprecedented disruption has been\\\\r\\\\nremarkable. Their resilience, creativity in finding innovative ways to\\\\r\\\\nbe of service, and willingness to do so --- amid many uncertainties\\\\r\\\\nabout what lies ahead personally and professionally --- are inspiring.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFew points have to be kept in mind for Medical Students\\' Participation\\\\r\\\\nin Direct Patient Contact\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Current medical students are students, not employees.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Medical students\\' participation in direct care of patients should be\\\\r\\\\n    **voluntary**, not required. Schools/college should document with\\\\r\\\\n    their medical students that their participation is purely voluntary\\\\r\\\\n    for public service or humanitarian reasons only and will not be\\\\r\\\\n    compensated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   To ensure patient and student safety, students must always be\\\\r\\\\n    appropriately supervised by faculty and other health professionals\\\\r\\\\n    acting within their scope of practice. Schools/college must be clear\\\\r\\\\n    in policies, language, and actions to consistently and genuinely\\\\r\\\\n    convey that students\\' participation is voluntary.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Opportunities to volunteer in direct patient care activities should\\\\r\\\\n    be offered to students *only* if there is a critical HCW need for\\\\r\\\\n    them to do so.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Student Health Services directors should actively participate in\\\\r\\\\n    screening potential student volunteers, including considering (a)\\\\r\\\\n    the responsibilities involved and (b) the student\\'s current health\\\\r\\\\n    status and the presence of chronic health conditions or other safety\\\\r\\\\n    risks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Prevention and control of spread in schools/colleges**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe protection of children and educational facilities is particularly\\\\r\\\\nimportant. Precautions are necessary to prevent the potential spread of\\\\r\\\\nCOVID-19 in schools/colleges settings; however, care must also be taken\\\\r\\\\nto avoid stigmatizing students and staff who may have been exposed to\\\\r\\\\nthe virus. It is important to remember that COVID-19 does not\\\\r\\\\ndifferentiate between borders, ethnicities, disability status, age or\\\\r\\\\ngender. Education settings should continue to be welcoming, respectful,\\\\r\\\\ninclusive, and supportive environments to all. Measures taken by\\\\r\\\\nschools/colleges can prevent the entry and spread of COVID-19 by\\\\r\\\\nstudents and staff that may have been exposed to the virus, while\\\\r\\\\nminimizing disruption and protecting students and staff from\\\\r\\\\ndiscrimination.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFollowing basic principles can help keep students, teachers, and staff\\\\r\\\\nsafe at schools/colleges and help stop the spread of this disease.\\\\r\\\\nRecommendations for healthy schools/colleges are:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Sick students, teachers and other staff should not come to\\\\r\\\\n    schools/colleges\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Schools/colleges should enforce regular hand washing with safe water\\\\r\\\\n    and soap, alcohol rub/hand sanitizer or chlorine solution and, at a\\\\r\\\\n    minimum, daily disinfection and cleaning of schools/colleges\\\\r\\\\n    surfaces\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Schools/colleges should provide water, sanitation and waste\\\\r\\\\n    management facilities and follow environmental cleaning and\\\\r\\\\n    decontamination procedures\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Schools/colleges should promote social distancing (a term applied to\\\\r\\\\n    certain actions that are taken to slow down the spread of a highly\\\\r\\\\n    contagious disease, including limiting large groups of people coming\\\\r\\\\n    together)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Continuing education during COVID 19,**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMost governments\\xa0around the world have temporarily closed educational\\\\r\\\\ninstitutions in an attempt to contain the spread of the\\xa0[COVID-19\\\\r\\\\npandemic](http://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).\\\\r\\\\nIn the case of absenteeism/sick leave or temporary school closures,\\\\r\\\\nsupport continued access to quality education.

Fake information about\\\\r\\\\nthe\\xa0[novel coronavirus](https://www.latimes.com/topic/health)\\xa0appears to\\\\r\\\\nbe contagious. The temptation to share unverified but alarming\\\\r\\\\ninformation is understandable. Many of the people who share hoaxes don\\'t\\\\r\\\\ndo it to mislead; they think they\\'re sharing valuable information with\\\\r\\\\ntheir friends and family. But it\\'s easy to hit \\\\\"retweet\\\\\" on something\\\\r\\\\nthat\\'s just not true. And false information isn\\'t helpful to anyone.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSeparating fact from fiction accurately can seem daunting. But getting\\\\r\\\\nto the truth is always worth the effort -- even if it\\\\\\\\\\'s not what you\\\\r\\\\nwant to hear!. Here are some ways by which one can differentiate between\\\\r\\\\nfake news and real news:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Develop a Critical Mindset**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne of the main reasons fake news is such a big issue is that it is\\\\r\\\\noften believable, which means it\\\\\\\\\\'s easy to get caught out. Many fake\\\\r\\\\nnews stories are also written to create \\\\\\\\\\\\\"shock\\\\\\\\\\\\\" value. This means\\\\r\\\\nit\\\\\\\\\\'s essential that you keep your emotional response to such stories in\\\\r\\\\ncheck. Instead, approach what you see and hear rationally and critically\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Check the Source**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf you come across a story from a source that you\\\\\\\\\\'ve never heard of\\\\r\\\\nbefore, do some digging! Find out a bit more about the publisher -- is\\\\r\\\\nit a professional and well-known news agency or is it someone\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\npersonal blog?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCheck the URL of the page, too. (A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is\\\\r\\\\na web address that helps browsers to find a site on the internet.)\\\\r\\\\nStrange-sounding URLs that end in extensions like \\\\\\\\\\\\\".infonet\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\".offer,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" rather than \\\\\\\\\\\\\".com\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\".co.uk,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or that contain spelling\\\\r\\\\nerrors, may mean that the source is suspect.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **See Who Else Is Reporting the Story**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCheck whether the story has been picked up by other well-known news\\\\r\\\\npublishers. Stories from organizations like Reuters, CNN and the BBC,\\\\r\\\\nwill have been checked and verified beforehand. If the information you\\\\r\\\\nhave isn\\\\\\\\\\'t from a well-known source like these, there\\\\\\\\\\'s a chance that\\\\r\\\\nit could be fake.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Look for Fake Images**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nModern editing software has made it easy for people to create fake\\\\r\\\\nimages that look professional and real. In fact, research shows that\\\\r\\\\nonly half of us can tell when images are fake. However, there are some\\\\r\\\\nwarning signs you can look out for. Strange shadows on the image, for\\\\r\\\\nexample, or jagged edges around a figure. If you still have doubts, you\\\\r\\\\ncan use tools such as **Google Reverse Image Search** to check whether\\\\r\\\\nthe image has been altered or used in the wrong context.\\\\r\\\\n\"},{\"title\":\"UNESCO\\'s initiatives\",\"slug\":\"unesco-initiatives\",\"content\":\"-   **UNESCO\\'s initiatives:** Mapping school closure, promoting\\\\r\\\\n    creativity and heritage during COVID, world heritage sites\\\\r\\\\n    management, share facts and stop disinformation\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> UNESCO is launching initiatives to support cultural industries and\\\\r\\\\n> cultural heritage as billions of people around the world turn to\\\\r\\\\n> culture for comfort and to overcome social isolation during the\\\\r\\\\n> COVID-19 sanitary crisis, which is hitting the culture sector hard.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\"The global nature of the COVID-19 crisis is a call for the\\\\r\\\\ninternational community to reinvest in international cooperation and\\\\r\\\\nintergovernmental dialogue\\\\\" said Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of\\\\r\\\\nUNESCO. \\\\\"UNESCO is committed to leading a global discussion on how best\\\\r\\\\nto support artists and cultural institutions during the COVID-19\\\\r\\\\npandemic and beyond, and ensure everyone can stay in touch with the\\\\r\\\\nheritage and culture that connects them to their humanity.\\\\\" UNESCO is\\\\r\\\\nalso launching an\\xa0online exhibition\\xa0of dozens of heritage properties\\\\r\\\\nacross the globe with technical support from Google Arts & Culture.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Organization will furthermore provide up-to-date information through\\\\r\\\\nan online map on its website and through social media on the impact of,\\\\r\\\\nand responses to, COVID-19 on World Heritage sites, which are partly or\\\\r\\\\nfully closed to visitors in 89% of countries due to the pandemic.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUNESCO will also share first-hand accounts by World Heritage site\\\\r\\\\nmanagers, who are particularly well placed to bear testimony on the\\\\r\\\\nimpact of COVID-19 on the sites they manage and the communities living\\\\r\\\\naround them.

Basic cognitive and social skills; ability to recognize,\\\\r\\\\nexpress and modulate one\\'s own emotions, as well as empathize with\\\\r\\\\nothers; \\ufb02exibility and ability to cope with adverse life events and\\\\r\\\\nfunction in social roles; and harmonious relationship between body and\\\\r\\\\nmind represent important components of mental health which contribute,\\\\r\\\\nto varying degrees, to the state of internal equilibrium.\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll components proposed in the de\\ufb01nition represent important but not\\\\r\\\\nmandatory aspects of mental health; as a matter of fact, they may\\\\r\\\\ncontribute to a varying degree to the state of equilibrium, so that\\\\r\\\\nfully developed functions may offset impairment in another aspect of\\\\r\\\\nmental functioning. For instance, a very empathetic person, highly\\\\r\\\\ninterested in mutual sharing, may compensate for a moderate degree of\\\\r\\\\ncognitive impairment, and still \\ufb01nd a satisfactory equilibrium and\\\\r\\\\npursue her/his life goals.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBasic cognitive and social skills are regarded as an important component\\\\r\\\\nof mental health in the light of their impact on all aspects of everyday\\\\r\\\\nlife(12-15).Cognitive skills include the ability to pay attention,\\\\r\\\\nremember and organize information, solve problems, and make decisions;\\\\r\\\\nsocial skills involve the ability to use one\\'s own repertoire of\\\\r\\\\nverbal/non-verbal abilities to communicate and interact with others. All\\\\r\\\\nthese abilities are interdependent and allow people to function in their\\\\r\\\\nenvironment. Reference to the \\\\\"basic\\\\\" level of these abilities is meant\\\\r\\\\nto clarify that mild degrees of impairment are compatible with mental\\\\r\\\\nhealth, while moderate to severe degrees of impairment, especially if\\\\r\\\\nnot balanced by other aspects, may require support by other members of\\\\r\\\\nthe society and a number of social incentives\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe inclusion of a harmonious relationship between body and mind is\\\\r\\\\nbased on the concept that mind, brain, organism and environment are\\\\r\\\\nheavily interconnected, and the overall experience of being in the world\\\\r\\\\ncannot be separated from the way in which one\\'s body feels in its\\\\r\\\\nenvironment. Disturbances of this interaction may result in psychotic\\\\r\\\\nexperiences, eating disorders, self-harm, body dysmorphic disorder or\\\\r\\\\npoor physical health.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFlexibility and ability to cope with adverse events are also deemed\\\\r\\\\nimportant to mental health maintenance. Flexibility refers to the\\\\r\\\\nability to revise a course of action in the face of unpredicted\\\\r\\\\ndif\\ufb01culties or obstacles, change one\\'s own ideas in the light of new\\\\r\\\\nevidence, and adapt to changes that different life epochs or contingent\\\\r\\\\nsituations may require.

Compared to the general\\\\r\\\\npopulation, people with mental health disorders are more likely to\\\\r\\\\nexperience a substance use disorder, repeatedly use alcohol and/or drugs\\\\r\\\\nto the point of impairment, and neglect major responsibilities at home,\\\\r\\\\nwork, or school.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYouth who have experienced a major depressive episode are twice as\\\\r\\\\nlikely to start using alcohol or an illicit drug.

Substance\\\\r\\\\nuse shares many characteristics with mental illness. Prevention efforts\\\\r\\\\nand early treatment are bene\\ufb01cial for people who are at risk for both\\\\r\\\\nsubstance use and mental health disorders. A recent U.S. Surgeon\\\\r\\\\nGeneral\\'s report highlights the scope of substance use (including\\\\r\\\\nalcohol) and its negative health impacts for individuals and the nation.\\\\r\\\\nBecause mental health and substance use disorders are complicated and\\\\r\\\\ninvolve biological, psychological, and social elements, the Substance\\\\r\\\\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) supports an\\\\r\\\\nintegrated treatment approach to co-occurring disorders.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis approach allows practitioners to comprehensively address symptoms\\\\r\\\\nand underlying causes, which often lowers the cost of treatment and\\\\r\\\\nleads to better outcomes. Substance use is not the only disorder that\\\\r\\\\noccurs at the same time as mental health disorders. Different mental\\\\r\\\\nhealth disorders can occur together (like anxiety and depression) or\\\\r\\\\nmental health disorders can overlap with physical health disorders (like\\\\r\\\\ndepression and diabetes).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSymptoms of mental health disorders can also be similar to other\\\\r\\\\nconditions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**[For example,]{.underline}**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the name for a group of developmental\\\\r\\\\ndisorders often characterized by impairments in the ability to\\\\r\\\\ncommunicate and interact with others. ASD includes a wide range of\\\\r\\\\nsymptoms, skills, and levels of disability.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThese disorders occur in about 1.5 percent of children and often\\\\r\\\\nco-occur with disorders such as depression, anxiety, and sensory\\\\r\\\\nintegration disorder\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**[Mental health determinants]{.underline}**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdolescence is a crucial period for developing and maintaining social\\\\r\\\\nand emotional habits important for mental well-being. These include\\\\r\\\\nadopting healthy sleep patterns; taking regular exercise; developing\\\\r\\\\ncoping, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills; and learning to\\\\r\\\\nmanage emotions. Supportive environments in the family, at school and in\\\\r\\\\nthe wider community are also important. An estimated 10**--**20% of\\\\r\\\\nadolescents globally experience mental health conditions, yet these\\\\r\\\\nremain underdiagnosed and undertreated\\xa0*(1)*.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMultiple factors determine mental health outcomes. The more risk factors\\\\r\\\\nadolescents are exposed to, the greater the potential impact on their\\\\r\\\\nmental health. Factors that can contribute to stress during adolescence\\\\r\\\\ninclude a desire for greater autonomy, pressure to conform with peers,\\\\r\\\\nexploration of sexual identity, and increased access to and use of\\\\r\\\\ntechnology. Media influence and gender norms can exacerbate the\\\\r\\\\ndisparity between an adolescent\\'s lived reality and their perceptions or\\\\r\\\\naspirations for the future. Other important determinants include the\\\\r\\\\nquality of their home life and relationships with peers. Violence\\\\r\\\\n(including harsh parenting and bullying) and socioeconomic problems are\\\\r\\\\nrecognized risks to mental health. Children and adolescents are\\\\r\\\\nespecially vulnerable to sexual violence, which has a clear association\\\\r\\\\nwith detrimental mental health.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSome adolescents are at greater risk of mental health conditions due to\\\\r\\\\ntheir living conditions, stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of\\\\r\\\\naccess to quality support and services. These include adolescents living\\\\r\\\\nin humanitarian and fragile settings; adolescents with chronic illness,\\\\r\\\\nautism spectrum disorder, an intellectual disability or other\\\\r\\\\nneurological condition; pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, or\\\\r\\\\nthose in early and/or forced marriages; orphans; and adolescents from\\\\r\\\\nminority ethnic or sexual backgrounds or other discriminated groups.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdolescents with mental health conditions are in turn particularly\\\\r\\\\nvulnerable to social exclusion, discrimination, stigma (affecting\\\\r\\\\nreadiness to seek help), educational difficulties, risk-taking\\\\r\\\\nbehaviours, physical ill-health and human rights violations.\\xa0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Childhood behavioural disorders**\\\\r\\\\n    -----------------------------------\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChildhood behavioural disorders are the second leading cause of disease\\\\r\\\\nburden in young adolescents aged 10--14 years and the eleventh leading\\\\r\\\\ncause among older adolescents aged 15--19 years. Childhood behavioural\\\\r\\\\ndisorders include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\\\\r\\\\n(characterized by difficulty paying attention, excessive activity and\\\\r\\\\nacting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not\\\\r\\\\nappropriate for a person\\\\\\\\\\'s age), and conduct disorder (with symptoms of\\\\r\\\\ndestructive or challenging behaviour). Childhood behavioural disorders\\\\r\\\\ncan affect adolescents\\' education and may result in criminal behaviour.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Eating disorders**\\\\r\\\\n    --------------------\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEating disorders commonly emerge during adolescence and young adulthood.\\\\r\\\\nEating disorders affect females more commonly than males. Conditions\\\\r\\\\nsuch as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are\\\\r\\\\ncharacterised by harmful eating behaviours such as restricting calories\\\\r\\\\nor binge eating.\\xa0 data-sf-ec-immutable=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\>Eating disorders are\\\\r\\\\ndetrimental to health and often co-exist with depression, anxiety and/or\\\\r\\\\nsubstance misuse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Psychosis**\\\\r\\\\n    -------------\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConditions that include symptoms of psychosis most commonly emerge in\\\\r\\\\nlate adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can include hallucinations\\\\r\\\\nor delusions. These experiences can impair an adolescent\\'s ability to\\\\r\\\\nparticipate in daily life and education and often lead to stigma or\\\\r\\\\nhuman rights violations.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Suicide and self-harm**\\\\r\\\\n    -------------------------\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn estimated 62\\xa0000 adolescents died in 2016 as a result of self-harm.\\xa0\\\\r\\\\nSuicide is the third leading cause of death in older adolescents (15--19\\\\r\\\\nyears). Nearly 90% of the world\\'s adolescents live in low-or\\\\r\\\\nmiddle-income countries and more than 90% of adolescent suicides are\\\\r\\\\namong adolescents living in those countries. Risk factors for suicide\\\\r\\\\nare multifaceted, including harmful use of alcohol, abuse in childhood,\\\\r\\\\nstigma against help-seeking, barriers to accessing care and access to\\\\r\\\\nmeans. Communication through digital media about suicidal behaviour is\\\\r\\\\nan emerging concern for this age group.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Risk-taking behaviours**\\\\r\\\\n    --------------------------\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMany risk-taking behaviours for health, such as substance use or sexual\\\\r\\\\nrisk taking, start during adolescence. Risk-taking behaviours can be\\\\r\\\\nboth an unhelpful strategy to cope with poor mental health and can\\\\r\\\\nseverely impact an adolescent\\'s mental and physical well-being.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWorldwide, the prevalence of episodic drinking among adolescents aged\\\\r\\\\n15\\xad--19 years was 13.6% in 2016, with males most at risk.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe use of tobacco and cannabis are additional concerns. In 2016, based\\\\r\\\\non data available from 130 countries, it was estimated that 5.6% of\\\\r\\\\n15--16-year-olds had used cannabis at least once in the preceding\\\\r\\\\nyear\\xa0*(2)*. Many adult smokers have their first cigarette prior to the\\\\r\\\\nage of 18 years.\\xa0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPerpetration of violence is a risk-taking behaviour that can increase\\\\r\\\\nthe likelihood of low educational attainment, injury, involvement with\\\\r\\\\ncrime or death. Interpersonal violence was ranked the second leading\\\\r\\\\ncause of death of older adolescent boys in 2016.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **Early detection and treatment**\\\\r\\\\n    ---------------------------------\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is crucial to address the needs of adolescents with defined mental\\\\r\\\\nhealth conditions. Avoiding institutionalization and\\\\r\\\\nover-medicalization, prioritizing nonpharmacological approaches, and\\\\r\\\\nrespecting the rights of children in line with the United Nations\\\\r\\\\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights instruments\\\\r\\\\nare key for adolescents.

This might be a work issue, dealing with relationship con\\ufb02ict,\\\\r\\\\nor debt problems.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStress isn\\'t an illness or a disorder, but it can develop into one if it\\\\r\\\\nis left to become chronic.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile a little bit of stress is normal and can have positive results\\\\r\\\\nlike getting you motivated or taking useful risks in the workplace too\\\\r\\\\nmuch stress over too long of a period can begin to negatively affect all\\\\r\\\\nparts of your life.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou might \\ufb01nd it harder to function and concentrate at work, lose\\\\r\\\\ninterest in your social life, and \\ufb01nd yourself being irritable with\\\\r\\\\nthose you love.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPhysically perhaps you aren\\'t sleeping well, are under or overeating,\\\\r\\\\nand have signs of muscle tension including headaches and stomachaches.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt worse, it can lead to high blood pressure and other serious health\\\\r\\\\nissues.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStress is a normal part of life. A little bit of stress is beneficial\\\\r\\\\nand motivating, but too much stress can lead to high blood pressure,\\\\r\\\\nweight gain, and even heart disease. There are some key ways your body\\\\r\\\\nlets you know when you\\'re experiencing too much stress. Some of the\\\\r\\\\nwarning signs include:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Inability to concentrate or complete tasks\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Trouble falling asleep or staying awake\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Feeling overwhelmed\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Memory problems\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   A change in eating habits\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Feeling angry or irritable\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Having trouble functioning at work\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Getting sick often\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Headaches and body aches\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   **[What is Depression?]{.underline}**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJust like life challenges and chronic stress are different, low moods\\\\r\\\\nand depression are not the same beast.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile everyone feels down now and then, depression is a serious issue\\\\r\\\\nthat involves feeling low for several weeks or longer, even for years in\\\\r\\\\nsome cases.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt can be triggered by one dif\\ufb01cult experience, a buildup of things that\\\\r\\\\nbecome too much for you, or, often, seems to just arrive out of the blue\\\\r\\\\nwith no explanation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDepression is often based on old, repressed emotions that are making\\\\r\\\\ntheir way to the surface. As such, it rarely responds to logic. You\\\\r\\\\ncan\\'t just \\'\\ufb01x it\\', or achieve or \\ufb01nish something that will make it go\\\\r\\\\naway. For example, if you moved to a new village and started feeling\\\\r\\\\nlow, it\\'s unlikely moving again will completely sort your depression.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBecause of its irrationality, depression can often feel out of control.\\\\r\\\\nYou might feel like you are acting like someone else altogether, unable\\\\r\\\\nto connect to people around you.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDepression tends to leave you feeling exhausted, even if you are\\\\r\\\\nsleeping (and often depression disrupts good sleep). It can feel like\\\\r\\\\nsomething is draining all your energy and like your head is \\ufb01lled with\\\\r\\\\nsand and you can\\'t think straight\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDepression is a mental health condition that interferes with a person\\'s\\\\r\\\\nability to carry out daily functions. It\\'s characterized by feelings of\\\\r\\\\nsadness and a loss of interest in once enjoyable activities.

It tends to have an obvious\\\\r\\\\ntrigger, like a move, divorce, or illness. Stress typically resolves as\\\\r\\\\nlife events change. However, stress can lead to mental health problems\\\\r\\\\nlike anxiety and depression if it persists over long periods without\\\\r\\\\nrelief.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhereas,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDepression is a mental health condition that requires a medical\\\\r\\\\ndiagnosis. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an\\\\r\\\\nestimated 17.3 million American adults experienced at least one major\\\\r\\\\ndepressive episode in 2017. While stress is related to life events,\\\\r\\\\ndepression can happen -- and it can last for years\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSustained or chronic\\xa0**stress**, in particular, leads to elevated\\\\r\\\\nhormones such as cortisol, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**stress**\\xa0hormone,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and reduced\\\\r\\\\nserotonin and other neurotransmitters in the brain, including dopamine,\\\\r\\\\nwhich has been linked to\\xa0**depression**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn broad strokes, stress is usually situational or environmental and\\\\r\\\\noften a small change can alleviate the problem.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDepression, on the flipside, can develop in response to unresolved past\\\\r\\\\nissues, and sometimes occurs while life is seemingly great and last for\\\\r\\\\nweeks, months or even years. It is an illness that can also be caused by\\\\r\\\\nmedical conditions, genetics, and yes, stress.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoth depression and stress are incredibly common. There are hundreds of\\\\r\\\\nsurveys about stressed-out Americans because dealing with stress is\\\\r\\\\nsynonymous with being human.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYoung people of all ages feel stressed about school. Adults experience\\\\r\\\\nstress due to work and family, their health, the health of their loved\\\\r\\\\nones and the economy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt\\'s virtually impossible to avoid stress and important to know that not\\\\r\\\\nall stress is bad. Chronic untreated stress, however, is not healthy.

Most routines have been thrown\\\\r\\\\ninto disarray and the future, as far as the experts tell us, is far from\\\\r\\\\ncertain. This outbreak of COVID-19 has been stressful for people, and\\\\r\\\\nfear and anxiety about the disease can be overwhelming and cause strong\\\\r\\\\nemotions in adults and children.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLockdown, and hence self-isolation is forcing people to stay at home.\\\\r\\\\nThis sudden, but necessary step has added on to the prevailing stress\\\\r\\\\ndue to fear and apprehension of the disease itself. Therefore, it is\\\\r\\\\nnecessary for everyone to **understand the importance of lockdown.**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLockdown is meant to prevent the spread of infection from one person to\\\\r\\\\nanother, to protect ourselves and others. This means, not stepping out\\\\r\\\\nof the house except for buying necessities, reducing the number of trips\\\\r\\\\noutside, and ideally only a single, healthy family member making the\\\\r\\\\ntrips when absolutely necessary. If there is anyone in the house who is\\\\r\\\\nvery sick and may need to get medical help, you must be aware of the\\\\r\\\\nhealth facility nearest to you.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow, let\\'s focus on how we can **handle social isolation**. Staying at\\\\r\\\\nhome can be quite nice for some time, but can also be boring and\\\\r\\\\nrestricting. There are many ways to keep positive and cheerful. Let\\'s\\\\r\\\\ndiscuss them, pne by one. Being busy can really help keeping us\\\\r\\\\ndistracted from all the bad news and hence the stress incurred by them.\\\\r\\\\nHaving a regular schedule and helping in doing some of the work at home\\\\r\\\\ncan prove to be very helpful.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDistract yourself from negative emotions by listening to music, reading,\\\\r\\\\nwatching an entertaining programme on television. If you had old hobbies\\\\r\\\\nlike painting, gardening or stitching, go back to them. Rediscover your\\\\r\\\\nhobbies. Eat well and drink plenty of fluids. Be physically active. Do\\\\r\\\\nsimple indoor exercises that will keep you fit and feeling well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs we know, sharing is caring. So, try to understand if someone around\\\\r\\\\nyou needs advice, food or other essentials. Be willing to share your\\\\r\\\\nemotions as well. If you have children at home, keep them busy by\\\\r\\\\nallowing them to help in the household chores - make them feel\\\\r\\\\nresponsible and acquire new skills.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLikewise, it\\'s highly important to distinguish between hard facts and\\\\r\\\\nrumours/theories. Thus, we need to **focus on facts, rejecting rumours\\\\r\\\\nand theories.** Knowledge is power; the more you know about a certain\\\\r\\\\nissue, the less fearful you may feel. Make sure to access and believe\\\\r\\\\nonly the most reliable sources of information for self-protection. Do\\\\r\\\\nnot follow sensational news or social media posts which may impact your\\\\r\\\\nmental state. Do not spread or share any unverified news or information\\\\r\\\\nfurther. Do not keep discussing all the time about who got sick and how.\\\\r\\\\nInstead learn about who got well and recovered. Stick to the known\\\\r\\\\nadvice- hand hygiene and keeping a physical distance from others. It is\\\\r\\\\nbeing careful about yourself, and also about care of others. A common\\\\r\\\\ncold is not Corona infection. The symptoms of Corona have been well\\\\r\\\\ndescribed. Follow etiquette of sneezing, coughing, avoiding spitting in\\\\r\\\\npublic places etc. In most people, the Corona infection causes mild\\\\r\\\\nsymptoms and the person only needs to follow social distancing till\\\\r\\\\nhe/she stops being infective, usually 2 weeks. Mild infection does not\\\\r\\\\nrequire a person to be admitted in hospital. Only people who have\\\\r\\\\nbreathing difficulties need to be in hospital. Most people recover.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMoving on to the next topic; **Persons who have had previous mental\\\\r\\\\nillness** may face newer challenges during self-isolation or Covid\\\\r\\\\ninfection, therefore they require **special attention.** They would also\\\\r\\\\nhave the same fears and stress as others which may worsen their previous\\\\r\\\\nmental health condition. Social isolation may make them more withdrawn,\\\\r\\\\nmoody and irritable. They may not seek/ get easy access to medicines and\\\\r\\\\ncounselling. Thus, help and support is vital for persons with mental\\\\r\\\\nillness from their families and other care givers. Health helplines can\\\\r\\\\nprovide support, in addition to regular taking of prescribed medication,\\\\r\\\\na regular daily routine, keeping engaged and positive. Remember, good\\\\r\\\\nmental status in the difficult times may win you the battle more easily!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the end, I would like to sum up by sharing some messages for people\\\\r\\\\nin isolation; To keep their **mind and body** healthy. Stay connected\\\\r\\\\nand maintain your social networks. Try as much as possible to keep your\\\\r\\\\npersonal daily routines or create new routines if circumstances change.\\\\r\\\\nIf health authorities have recommended limiting your physical social\\\\r\\\\ncontact to contain the outbreak, you can stay connected via telephone,\\\\r\\\\ne-mail, social media or video conference. During times of stress, pay\\\\r\\\\nattention to your own needs and feelings. Engage in healthy activities\\\\r\\\\nthat you enjoy and find relaxing.

These can be difficult times for all of us as we hear about\\\\r\\\\nspread of COVID-19 from all over the world, through television, social\\\\r\\\\nmedia, newspapers, family and friends and other sources. The most common\\\\r\\\\nemotion faced by all is \\'fear\\'. It makes us anxious, panicky and can\\\\r\\\\neven possibly make us think, say or do things that we might not consider\\\\r\\\\nappropriate under normal circumstances.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLet us first try to understand some terms related to the present\\\\r\\\\nscenario.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Social distancing** refers to certain measures taken to stop or slow\\\\r\\\\ndown the spread of highly contagious diseases which include limiting\\\\r\\\\nlarge gatherings, closing down public buildings such as schools,\\\\r\\\\nuniversities, cancelling public events, etc.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Quarantine** is defined as the separation of people who have been\\\\r\\\\nexposed to a contagious disease to ascertain whether they become sick,\\\\r\\\\nthereby reducing the risk of them infecting others. Governments use\\\\r\\\\nquarantines to stop the spread of contagious diseases. Quarantines are\\\\r\\\\nfor people or groups who don\\'t have symptoms but were exposed to the\\\\r\\\\nsickness. A quarantine keeps them away from others so they don\\'t\\\\r\\\\nunknowingly infect anyone.\\xa0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nQuarantines may be used during **outbreaks (**sudden rise in the number\\\\r\\\\nof cases of a disease), **epidemics (s**imilar to outbreaks, but\\\\r\\\\ngenerally considered larger and more widespread), or **pandemics\\\\r\\\\n(**larger than epidemics, generally global in nature and affect more\\\\r\\\\npeople).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Isolation**, in contrast, is where a person diagnosed to have a\\\\r\\\\ncontagious disease is separated from the general population, to avoid\\\\r\\\\ntransmission of the disease to healthy people. While isolation serves\\\\r\\\\nthe same purpose as quarantine, it\\'s reserved for those who are already\\\\r\\\\nsick. It keeps *infected* people away from healthy people to prevent the\\\\r\\\\nsickness from spreading.\\xa0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPresently, governments across the world, including India, are using a\\\\r\\\\ncombination of these measures to stop the spread of the COVID-19\\\\r\\\\npandemic.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBased on studies from previous epidemics/pandemics, we shall identify\\\\r\\\\nsome of the mental health concerns which people in quarantine face and\\\\r\\\\npropose solutions/remedial measures for the same. Now let\\'s discuss a\\\\r\\\\nfew tips that we can follow to keep away anxiety and stress;\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**As we know, Exercise** reduces levels of cortisol, which is a stress\\\\r\\\\nhormone, and regular exercise is even more important now that you find\\\\r\\\\nyourself in self-isolation. Being at home almost all the time, abiding\\\\r\\\\nby the national lockdown, we all are prone to a sedentary lifestyle.\\\\r\\\\nHence working out at home becomes even more essential at this point of\\\\r\\\\ntime. When you move your body your heart pumps your white blood cells,\\\\r\\\\nyour immune defence, to all parts of the body which gives them a chance\\\\r\\\\nto do their job and scan the whole body for anything foreign.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Another important aspect to keep in mind is getting adequate sleep.**\\\\r\\\\nPoor sleep is linked to an increased risk of heart disease which is\\\\r\\\\nreason enough to aim for 7-8 hours\\' sleep a night. We also have a type\\\\r\\\\nof white blood cell called T-cells and research has shown that not\\\\r\\\\ngetting proper sleep prevents our T-cells from being able to fight\\\\r\\\\ninfection. Sleep also helps our body rest, restore and recover. Stress\\\\r\\\\nand anxiety can cause sleep problems but there are some simple steps we\\\\r\\\\ncan take to help improve the quality of our sleep. Focusing on eating a\\\\r\\\\nwell-balanced diet and daily exercise can also help.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNext thing to consider is if we have the habit of **smoking**, then we\\\\r\\\\nneed to reduce or stop it, because smoking puts our body at an increased\\\\r\\\\nrisk of developing both viral and bacterial infections. By smoking one\\\\r\\\\nis already challenging his/her lungs and COVID-19 is a respiratory\\\\r\\\\ndisease meaning it affects the health of our lungs. Therefore, it is\\\\r\\\\nrecommended to quit smoking for our heart health as well as to protect\\\\r\\\\nour immune system.\\xa0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**One more important precautionary measure would be to reduce alcohol\\\\r\\\\nintake, if any.** A glass of wine or two might commonly be used to help\\\\r\\\\nmanage feelings of stress, but alcohol can weaken our immune system. In\\\\r\\\\ntimes like these, it is recommended to reduce our alcohol intake and opt\\\\r\\\\nfor sleep, exercise and healthy food to combat stress and anxiety.\\xa0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile it might seem like the world is only talking about one topic right\\\\r\\\\nnow, enforced social isolation could also provide the perfect\\\\r\\\\nopportunity for many people to take a break from the news cycle. We\\\\r\\\\ncould actually focus on things that we usually do not get time for, like\\\\r\\\\ngardening, cooking, pickling, puzzles, craft, sewing, learning to\\\\r\\\\nmeditate, building furniture, reading books and so on. Now could be the\\\\r\\\\nperfect time to do them all, or some, or half of a few --- whatever one\\\\r\\\\ncan manage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlso, the WHO has advised, to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"draw on skills you have used in the past\\\\r\\\\nthat have helped you manage previous adversities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" So we can try\\\\r\\\\nfocussing on such activities.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Peggy Whitson (The first female commander of the International Space\\\\r\\\\nStation (ISS), who has spent a cumulative total of 665 days in space,\\\\r\\\\nwhich includes two six-month tours of duty), says that while on the ISS,\\\\r\\\\nshe would do things she\\'d been thinking about doing if she had more\\\\r\\\\ntime, and recommends people stuck at home during coronavirus lockdown do\\\\r\\\\nthe same. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"What are the things that you would do if you had more time?\\\\r\\\\nIs it to read? Is it to maybe write poetry or do art? What is the thing\\\\r\\\\nthat has been in the back of your head?\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs we know that periods of inactivity can be tricky, thus, **keeping\\\\r\\\\nbusy is a really good distraction from all the bad news we are receiving\\\\r\\\\nfrom time to time.**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmongst all other things, we should not forget to keep our home and\\\\r\\\\nourselves as clean as possible. It is highly recommended that we keep\\\\r\\\\nwashing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and use\\\\r\\\\na tissue to cover our mouth whenever we cough or sneeze. Focus on\\\\r\\\\ncleaning the surfaces that you touch a lot such as doorknobs, desks,\\\\r\\\\nkeyboards, mobile phones, your kitchen and bathroom.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHere are a few more pointers that could help you survive spiralling\\\\r\\\\nnegative thoughts about this uncertain time. Reframe \\\\\"I am stuck inside\\\\\"\\\\r\\\\nto \\\\\"I can finally focus on my home and myself\\\\\". Try to stay close to\\\\r\\\\nyour normal routine. Avoid obsessing over endless Coronavirus coverage.\\\\r\\\\nAlways remember that a chaotic home can lead to a chaotic mind. Start a\\\\r\\\\nnew quarantine ritual, if not done already. Use telehealth as an option\\\\r\\\\nto talk to a professional if your anxiety becomes unmanageable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Lastly, to lighten the burden of stress that we\\'re all carrying in our\\\\r\\\\nminds, due to this distressing situation, we can** try talking to our\\\\r\\\\nfamily members about our feelings, and mental health. Try to ask those\\\\r\\\\naround you about themselves, and how they\\'re dealing with this\\\\r\\\\nsituation. You can try to commit yourself to just paying attention. It\\\\r\\\\ncan prove to be really helpful. By recognizing that other people have\\\\r\\\\nmany of the same concerns or anxieties that you do, it makes you feel a\\\\r\\\\nlittle less alone.\\\\r\\\\n\"},{\"title\":\"Staying away from elderly\",\"slug\":\"staying-away-from-elderly\",\"content\":\"## Staying away from the elderly during the quarantine\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen it comes to COVID-19, older people are especially vulnerable to\\\\r\\\\nsevere illness.

Clean frequently\\\\r\\\\ntouched surfaces in your home often, including mobility and medical\\\\r\\\\nequipment used by your loved one, such as walkers, canes, and handrails.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPeople with loved ones in nursing homes assisted living facilities, and\\\\r\\\\nother types of senior living facilities may be understandably concerned\\\\r\\\\nabout their loved one\\'s risk of illness from COVID-19. To protect these\\\\r\\\\nvulnerable friends and family members, Centre for Disease Control and\\\\r\\\\nPrevention has advised that long-term care facilities - restrict\\\\r\\\\nvisitors, regularly check healthcare workers and residents for fevers\\\\r\\\\nand symptoms, and limit activities within the facility to keep residents\\\\r\\\\nsafe.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDevelop a care plan. A care plan summarizes your health conditions,\\\\r\\\\nmedications, healthcare providers, emergency contacts, and end-of-life\\\\r\\\\ncare options (for example, advance directives). Complete your care plan\\\\r\\\\nin consultation with your doctor, and if needed, with help from a family\\\\r\\\\nmember or home nurse aide. A care plan can have benefits beyond the\\\\r\\\\ncurrent pandemic. You can update your care plan every year, or any time\\\\r\\\\nyou have a change in your health or medications. Care plans can help\\\\r\\\\nreduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations and improve overall\\\\r\\\\nmedical management for people with a chronic health condition, resulting\\\\r\\\\nin a better quality of life.

The\\\\r\\\\nrapidly changing situation means that people are naturally\\xa0[grasping for\\\\r\\\\ninformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/media/stat-news-boston-coronavirus.html)\\xa0about\\\\r\\\\nthe pandemic. So what\\'s the best way to separate the trustworthy from\\\\r\\\\nthe fake?\\xa0\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLET US TALK ABOUT SOME COMMON QUESTIONS ON THIS TOPIC-\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n#### **Q)** How do you know whether a news source is trustworthy?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf the source isn\\'t one you\\'re familiar with, then Google it to make\\\\r\\\\nsure it is a legitimate news organization. The\\xa0[site \\\\\"Media Bias/Fact\\\\r\\\\nCheck\\\\\"](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)\\xa0rates various news\\\\r\\\\norganizations on \\\\\"factual reporting\\\\\" as well as ideological skew. Major\\\\r\\\\nhealth organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and\\\\r\\\\nPrevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are among the most\\\\r\\\\ncredible sources of information on the COVID-19 pandemic.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOnce you\\'ve made sure that the news source is reliable, check out the\\\\r\\\\nauthor. Consider whether the writer is a coronavirus or pandemic expert\\\\r\\\\nor just a scientist in a related field. If the author is a journalist,\\\\r\\\\ncheck to see what their usual beat is. Is this a health reporter with\\\\r\\\\nexperience covering scientific topics?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnother rule of thumb: \\\\\"Don\\'t just rely on one source\\\\\". Instead,\\\\r\\\\npractice what communication scholars call \\\\\"lateral reading\\\\\" and\\xa0gather\\\\r\\\\ninformation from a variety of diverse news sources. If a certain\\\\r\\\\nconclusion\\xa0appears repeatedly in different reliable sources, that should\\\\r\\\\nincrease your confidence in it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n#### Q) **How do I make sure the information in a report is legitimate? What are red flags to watch out for?**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCheck when the story was published.Especially for COVID-19 \\\\\\\\[news\\\\\\\\], the\\\\r\\\\ndate matters so much,, because \\\\\"a lot of the facts on the ground may\\\\r\\\\nhave changed,\\\\\" like case counts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTry to determine\\xa0*where\\xa0*the information presented is coming from. Is it\\\\r\\\\nfrom a state epidemiologist, the CDC or another trusted organization? If\\\\r\\\\nthere\\'s a link to the source, click on that link to double-check the\\\\r\\\\ndata yourself. The \\\\\"click the links\\\\\" rule also applies to scrolling past\\\\r\\\\nheadlines on social media: Read the article before you share.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\"Take a deep breath and be skeptical, especially when you see the\\\\r\\\\nfollowing red flags: too-good-to-be-true headlines or news that plays\\\\r\\\\nstrongly to emotional cues instead of taking a level-headed approach.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n####  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf you realize you\\'ve already shared misinformation, you should\\\\r\\\\nself-correct, ideally by deleting the original, inaccurate statement and\\\\r\\\\ncreate a new post, email or text---whichever platform you originally\\\\r\\\\nshared it on---with the accurate information. Alternatively, you can\\\\r\\\\nprominently update your original post with the correction, although\\\\r\\\\npeople may not see the updated version on their feeds.

With approximately half the population of the\\\\r\\\\nworld under such orders, families are figuring out how to explain global\\\\r\\\\nevents to their children while keeping them safe, healthy and active.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\"For cohabiting families, \\'social distancing\\' actually means \\'enforced\\\\r\\\\nintimacy.\\' Many family members are spending more time together under the\\\\r\\\\nsame roof, with fewer outlets for socializing and recreation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll of that raises the question: How do parents and other primary\\\\r\\\\ncaregivers reduce stress for the whole family ,especially their children\\\\r\\\\nduring a prolonged period of social distancing?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTake time to talk to your Child,and try to explain them about COVID-19\\\\r\\\\nin simpler terms.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou know your child best. Let their questions be your guide as to how\\\\r\\\\nmuch information to provide. However, don\\'t avoid giving them the\\\\r\\\\ninformation that health experts identify as critical to ensuring your\\\\r\\\\nchild\\'s health. Be patient; children and young people do not always talk\\\\r\\\\nabout their concerns readily. Watch for clues that they may want to\\\\r\\\\ntalk, such as hovering around while you do the dishes. It is very\\\\r\\\\ntypical for younger children to ask a few questions, return to playing,\\\\r\\\\nthen come back to ask more questions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen sharing information, it is important make sure to provide facts\\\\r\\\\nwithout promoting a high level of stress, remind children that adults\\\\r\\\\nare working to address this concern, and give children actions they can\\\\r\\\\ntake to protect themselves.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Now let us talk about some**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Age / Developmental Stage Based Descriptions about to what should be\\\\r\\\\nthe conversation with which age group**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Infants and toddlers ( 6 years)** are unlikely to understand the\\\\r\\\\nimplications of COVID-19. But they can understand when a caregiver is\\\\r\\\\nworried, sad, or upset. Children this age may not have words to describe\\\\r\\\\ntheir feelings but they may be more fussy than usual or show changes in\\\\r\\\\ntheir sleep or feeding patterns. Maintaining routines, and consistency\\\\r\\\\nin caregivers and environments is important because it provides a sense\\\\r\\\\nof security and safety. They may need more physical comforting and\\\\r\\\\nsoothing than usual from their caregivers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Preschoolers (3 - 5 years)** may understand basic ideas about germs\\\\r\\\\nand being sick. Maintaining routines and minimizing exposure to adult\\\\r\\\\nsources of information (television, online information) is important.\\\\r\\\\nEncouraging normal play and reading with children this age can be\\\\r\\\\nhelpful because preschoolers\\' often use play to understand and organize\\\\r\\\\ntheir feelings. Offering brief explanations while focusing on prevention\\\\r\\\\nand practicing hygiene behaviors (e.g., counting or singing while hand\\\\r\\\\nwashing) can help children feel a sense of control. Letting them know\\\\r\\\\nthat you are there to keep them safe can help reduce fears or anxiety.\\\\r\\\\nChildren this age may also need more physical comforting and\\\\r\\\\nreassurance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**School age children (\\\\\\\\> 6 years**) may have more questions. Keep your\\\\r\\\\nexplanations simple and factual. Give them opportunities to explore\\\\r\\\\ntheir feelings and concerns, and provide appropriate assurances about\\\\r\\\\nyour efforts (and the school\\'s efforts) to keep them safe. Supervise\\\\r\\\\ntelevision/internet use and be available to answer questions that arise\\\\r\\\\nfrom media exposure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Adolescents (\\\\\\\\> 13 years)** can cognitively process information much\\\\r\\\\nlike adults, and may get information through school, peers, social\\\\r\\\\nmedia/ online sources, or television. They may be more likely to seek\\\\r\\\\nalternate sources of information or support (e.g., peers) than parents,\\\\r\\\\nsome of which may not be accurate. They will benefit from your emotional\\\\r\\\\nsupport, discussing the facts, and help with setting appropriate limits\\\\r\\\\nrelated to media and internet use. Focus on listening, and invite your\\\\r\\\\nadolescent children to join you in watching and discussing COVID related\\\\r\\\\nnews, or in exploring online information together.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**NOW LETS TALK ABOUT WHAT A PARENT CAN DO FOR HIS/HER CHILD-**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Find Out What Your Child Already Knows\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Ask questions geared to your child\\\\\\\\\\'s age level.**\\xa0For older kids, you\\\\r\\\\nmight ask, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"What are you hearing about coronavirus?

If you are\\\\r\\\\nlimiting physical contact with others and social events, consider\\\\r\\\\nalternate ways of staying connected to friends and family through phone\\\\r\\\\ncalls, video conferencing, or making cards and writing emails or\\\\r\\\\nletters. This helps children stay emotionally connected to the people\\\\r\\\\nthey care about.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\u2022 If your child has pre-existing medical conditions, it is important\\\\r\\\\nthat you consult with your child\\'s primary care provider about\\\\r\\\\nadditional precautions for your child, and speak to your child about\\\\r\\\\ninformation specific to him/ her.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**[Explore how your child is responding to information and changes\\\\r\\\\nwithin your own community.]{.underline}**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\u2022 Consider the age and personality of each of your children, as well as\\\\r\\\\ninformation from their schools, and local public health sources, when\\\\r\\\\ntalking to your children. For instance, ask about what information is\\\\r\\\\nbeing shared in school and explore how your children are responding to\\\\r\\\\nit. Some children may respond with more anxiety than others, and\\\\r\\\\nsiblings may differ in their reactions. Anxiety can change how we\\\\r\\\\nevaluate information (e.g., we may overestimate or underestimate the\\\\r\\\\nrisks or our ability to cope). You may notice that your children\\'s mood\\\\r\\\\nand behaviors are different than usual because experiencing these extra\\\\r\\\\nworries can impact how they are thinking and feeling.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[**Balance flexibility with maintaining routines**-]{.underline}\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Even though you may need to be flexible and responsive to\\\\r\\\\n    accommodate changes in work or school schedules, try to maintain\\\\r\\\\n    normal routines and prioritize family time (e.g., homework, family\\\\r\\\\n    meal times) as much as possible. Familiar routines and\\\\r\\\\n    predictability help children feel that life is going on as normal,\\\\r\\\\n    which can help them feel safe and secure when other aspects of life\\\\r\\\\n    feel out of control or unpredictable\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\u2022 Allow flexibility in your own routine.

Teaching students\\' positive preventive measures, talking with\\\\r\\\\n> them about their fears, and giving them a sense of some control over\\\\r\\\\n> their risk of infection can help reduce anxiety.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n Let us talk about some Specific Guidelines for teachers that would help us to cope with the situation.\\\\r\\\\n======================================================================================================\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> **Remain calm and reassuring**.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Students will react to and follow your verbal and nonverbal\\\\r\\\\n    reactions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   What you say and do about COVID-19, current prevention efforts, and\\\\r\\\\n    related events can either increase or decrease your student\\'s\\\\r\\\\n    anxiety.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   If true, emphasize to your student that they and their family are\\\\r\\\\n    fine.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Remind them that you and the teachers at their school, and their\\\\r\\\\n    parents are there to keep them safe and healthy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Let students talk about their feelings and help reframe their\\\\r\\\\n    concerns into the appropriate perspective.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMake yourself available.\\\\r\\\\n========================\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Students may need extra attention from you and may want to talk\\\\r\\\\n    about their concerns, fears, and questions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   It is important that they know they have someone who will listen to\\\\r\\\\n    them; make time for them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   For parents. tell them you love them and give them plenty of\\\\r\\\\n    affection.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAvoid excessive blaming.\\\\r\\\\n========================\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   When tensions are high, sometimes we try to blame someone.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   It is important to avoid stereotyping any one group of people as\\\\r\\\\n    responsible for the virus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Bullying or negative comments made toward others should be stopped\\\\r\\\\n    and reported to the school.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Be aware of any comments that other adults are having. You may have\\\\r\\\\n    to explain what comments mean if they are different than the values\\\\r\\\\n    that you have at home or in the school.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMonitor television viewing and social media.\\\\r\\\\n============================================\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Limit television viewing or access to information on the Internet\\\\r\\\\n    and through social media. Try to avoid watching or listening to\\\\r\\\\n    information that might be upsetting when your student is present.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Tal to students about how many stories about COVID-19 on the\\\\r\\\\n    Internet may be based on rumors and inaccurate information.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Talk to students about factual information of this disease---this\\\\r\\\\n    can help reduce anxiety.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Constantly watching updates on the status of COVID-19 can increase\\\\r\\\\n    anxiety---avoid this.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Be aware that developmentally inappropriate information (i.e.,\\\\r\\\\n    information designed for adults) can cause anxiety or confusion,\\\\r\\\\n    particularly in young students.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Stay connected with each and every student of the class.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMaintain a normal routine to the extent possible.\\\\r\\\\n=================================================\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Keep to a regular schedule, as this can be reassuring and promotes\\\\r\\\\n    physical and mental health and wellbeing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Encourage your students to keep up with their schoolwork and\\\\r\\\\n    extracurricular activities, but don\\'t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\npush them if they seem overwhelmed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBe honest and accurate.\\\\r\\\\n=======================\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   In the absence of factual information, students often imagine\\\\r\\\\n    situations far worse than reality.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Don\\'t ignore their concerns, but rather explain that at the present\\\\r\\\\n    moment, very few people in this country are sick with COVID-19.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Students can be told this disease is thought to be spread between\\\\r\\\\n    people who are in close contact with one another---when an infected\\\\r\\\\n    person coughs or sneezes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   It is also thought it can be spread when you touch an infected\\\\r\\\\n    surface or object, which is why it is so important to protect\\\\r\\\\n    yourself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Teachers can share news and updates from reliable sources and assure\\\\r\\\\n    the students that we would come out of this very sson.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKnow the symptoms of COVID-19.\\\\r\\\\n==============================\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> These\\\\r\\\\n> [[symptoms]{.underline}](https://www.health.qld.gov.au/clinical-practice/guidelines-procedures/diseases-infection/diseases/coronavirus/public-info-novel-coronavirus/fact-sheet-coronavirus)\\\\r\\\\n> appear in a few days after being exposed to someone with the disease\\\\r\\\\n> or as long as 14 days after exposure:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Fever\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Cough\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Sore throat\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Fatigue\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Shortness for breath\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> For some people the symptoms are like having a cold; for others they\\\\r\\\\n> are quite severe or even life threatening. In either case it is\\\\r\\\\n> important to follow instructions about staying home from school or\\\\r\\\\n> away from public spaces to prevent the spread of the virus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReview and model basic hygiene and healthy lifestyle practices for protection.\\\\r\\\\n==============================================================================\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> Encourage students to practice every day good hygiene---simple steps\\\\r\\\\n> to prevent spread of illness:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Wash hands multiple times a day for at least 20 seconds (singing\\\\r\\\\n    Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star or Happy Birthday slowly takes about 20\\\\r\\\\n    seconds).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Cover their mouths with a tissue when they sneeze or cough and throw\\\\r\\\\n    away the tissue immediately, or sneeze or cough into the bend of\\\\r\\\\n    their elbow. Do not share food or drinks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Practice giving fist or elbow bumps instead of handshakes. Fewer\\\\r\\\\n    germs are spread this way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Giving students guidance on what they can do to prevent infection\\\\r\\\\n    gives them a greater sense of control over disease spread and will\\\\r\\\\n    help to reduce their anxiety.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Encourage students to eat a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and\\\\r\\\\n    exercise regularly; this will help them develop a strong immune\\\\r\\\\n    system to fight off illness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDiscuss new rules or practices at school.\\\\r\\\\n=========================================\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Many schools already enforce illness prevention habits, including\\\\r\\\\n    frequent hand washing or use of alcohol-based (sanitizer) hand\\\\r\\\\n    cleansers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Preschool** students are to be explained in a unique manner-\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   One of the best ways to keep children safe from coronavirus and\\\\r\\\\n    other diseases is to simply encourage regular handwashing, for at\\\\r\\\\n    least 20 seconds. It doesn\\\\\\\\\\'t need to be a scary conversation.\\xa0[Sing\\\\r\\\\n    along with The\\\\r\\\\n    Wiggles](https://www.facebook.com/unicef/posts/10157942700399002)\\xa0or\\xa0[follow\\\\r\\\\n

are washing their hands and find\\\\r\\\\n    ways to reward them for frequent/timely hand washing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n-   Use puppets or dolls to demonstrate symptoms (sneezing, coughing,\\\\r\\\\n
